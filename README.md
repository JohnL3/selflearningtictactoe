# Self Learning Tic Tac Toe

#### About this project
I choose to do this as a way to work on problem solving.  
It is intended as something for me to work at now and again as an ongoing project.  
I have created a Tic Tac Toe game and wanted to challange myself to see if I could improve on it.
This is when I thought of the idea of creating a Tic Tac Toe game that could teach itself or you could teach it not to loose.
### Instructions
+ As this is a work in progress You will ALWAYS have to choose X from the choose you side option .... and ALWAYS choose O from the choose who starts option
+ After each game you HAVE TO REPEAT THIS so that the computer starts first
+ Anywhere you see p1 ... p1 refers to player one Human
+ Anywher you see p2 ... p2 refers to player two computer
+ For computer to learn its self dont fill in the input boxes .... and just play the game ... over and over ... when it looses a game it will when it comes across these moves played again adjust its moves so as not to loose
+ If you want to speed up the process you can pick which move the computer makes to start with by entering a number from 1-9 in the P2 1st move input box. The computer will always start with that move until you change the value in the input or clear the value from the input. If you clear the value the computer will choose a random start move.
+ The P2 2nd move index option is to choose the computers second move .... you use an index number for this eg ... comp chooses 1 as first move and you as player are going to choose 7 for you first moves leaving 2,3,4,5,6,8,9 for computer to choose from for second move ... setting P2 2nd move index to 0 means computer will pick 2 for his second move
+ Using the P2 1st move input and P2 2nd move index input means you can find the loosing moves quicker and teach tic tac toe not to loose quicker. 
+ When you loose a game dont change the P2 1st move input and P2 2nd move index .... start game again and when you rerun it you will see it will choose a different move and update its game data for that move. From now on it will never loose to that play again. Now you can adjust the P2  2nd move index to test for more lossing games for the P2 1st move choice.
+ When you have all indexs checked you can then change the P1 1st move to another number and repeat everything again
+ Other items on screen are just visual aids to help me see what is going on eg data in boxes on right show data for a loosing game, and when a move is learned it shows in red, so I can tell visually it is working
+ Other displays shows quantity of wins losses and draws for each player
+ Comp second moves and comp third moves just show the move choices available at each move .... this helps me visualize the changes when computer learns and i can see the choices changing
