# Self Learning Tic Tac Toe

####About this project
I choose to do this as a way to work on problem solving.  
It is intended as something for me to work at now and again as an ongoing project.  
I have created a Tic Tac Toe game and wanted to challange myself to see if I could improve on it.
This is when I thought of the idea of creating a Tic Tac Toe game that could teach itself or you could teach it not to loose.
